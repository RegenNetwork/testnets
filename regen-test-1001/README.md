# Regen Ledger Incentivized Testnets

## Overview

*Our incentive program is inspired by [IRISNet](https://github.com/irisnet/testnets)'s program and borrows liberally from it.*

Regen Network will offer rewards to early testnet participants according to the points they have earned. The exact details regarding conversion of points to tokens will be described in another document pending legal approval.
