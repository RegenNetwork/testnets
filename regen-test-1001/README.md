# Regen Ledger Incentivized Testnets

## Overview

*Our incentive program is inspired by [IRISNet](https://github.com/irisnet/testnets)'s program and borrows liberally from it.*

Regen Network will offer rewards to early testnet participants according to the points they have earned. The exact details regarding conversion of points to tokens will be described in another document pending legal approval.

## Points and Instructions

The above points will be awarded to addresses by scripts or manual processes that look at relevant blocks and transactions.
In order to convert points into tokens at the end of the testnet program, you will need to prove that you own the
private key for the address that was awarded points through a signature and go through a KYC/AML process. Further
details for how to proceed with this process will be published at a later point.

## Notes

The rate at which points will be converted to tokens will be published after the end of the testnet program.

Regen Network Development, Inc. reserves the right to make adjustments to the above point structure in the event that
an unforeseen event halts the testnet prior to a particular goal being reached, as well as to add additional point-earning
activities as such activities become available on the testnet.
